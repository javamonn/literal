# Subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and analytics software, to run Literal. We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending GDPR safeguards everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Cloud services provider.
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/resource-center/). Cloud services provider.
- [Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/03/14/gdpr-sentry-and-you). Error reporting software.
- [Amplitude](https://blog.amplitude.com/amplitude-gdpr). Product analytics software.
